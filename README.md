**OBJECTIVE:**

Developed a comprehensive Library Management System using Python and SQL to optimize library operations. The system features:

**Adding Data:** Efficiently added books, authors, and borrower information to the database.

**Showing and Fetching Data:** Implemented search functions for retrieving book details and borrower records.

**Updating Records:** Enabled updates for book and borrower information, as well as transaction records.

**Deleting Records:** Secured the deletion of outdated or incorrect entries.

**Resetting Data:** Created mechanisms to reset the library database for accuracy and effective dataset management.

This project enhanced my database management skills and showcased my proficiency in Python for backend development and SQL for data manipulation and querying.
